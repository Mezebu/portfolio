              Hi there! {`I'm`} Henry, a passionate Frontend Developer with over
              three years of experience in creating websites and web
              applications. I have a {`master's`} degree in computing from South
              East Technological University, and I love bringing creativity and
              technical skills to exciting projects.
            </Typography>

              In my recent job at Shield Tech Hub, I worked with a fantastic
              team to build custom eCommerce websites. I used tools like
              Commerce.js to make online shopping easier and more enjoyable for
              users. Before that, at PCCCZ Nigeria Company LTD, I helped improve
              web pages using JavaScript and frameworks like Bootstrap and MUI,
              making them more interactive and user-friendly.
            </Typography>

              My journey in tech started at Font-IT Limited, where I managed
              office tasks and provided administrative support, which helped me
              develop strong organizational skills. Over the years, {`I’ve`}{" "}
              become skilled in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Next.js, and
              many other technologies. I also know how to use Git for version
              control, AWS for cloud services, and MongoDB for databases.
            </Typography>
            <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
              During my {`master's`} program, I worked on projects like a Movie
              Web App and a Serverless Web API. These projects helped me put my
              skills to the test and learn more about using ReactJS and AWS
              services to create efficient and scalable solutions.
            </Typography>

              When {`I'm`} not coding, I volunteer with The Brothers of Charity
              Services South East, where I provide care and support to
              individuals with intellectual disabilities. This experience has
              taught me the value of patience, empathy, and detailed
              documentation. I love working in team environments where I can
              contribute and grow professionally. {`I’m`} excited to bring my
              skills and passion to new challenges and opportunities.

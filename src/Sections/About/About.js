              Hello, my name is Henry and I enjoy building functional and
              visually appealing interactive web apps that provide a positive
              user experience. {"I've"} been interested with technology since I
              was a youngster. I recall thinking it would be a fantastic idea to
              disassemble the family computer. Despite being aware of the
              ramifications, I was curious to see how everything functioned on
              the inside. People would have scoffed if someone stated a few
              years ago that they could fit a computer in their bag. We are now
              at a point where almost everything is feasible, thanks to the
              problem-solving abilities of computer scientists.

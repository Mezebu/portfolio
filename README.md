This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## My Portfolio Website

Welcome to my portfolio website! This website was built using React.js and Next.js, with additional libraries including Framer Motion and Material-UI. The website showcases my skills, projects, and experience as a software developer.

## Features

- Dark mode toggle: The website includes a dark mode toggle that allows users to switch between light and dark mode.
- Responsive design: The website is designed to be fully responsive and accessible on a range of devices and screen sizes.
- Animated transitions: Framer Motion is used to create smooth animated transitions and effects throughout the website.
- Material design components: Material-UI is used to implement a range of pre-built UI components with a consistent and polished look and feel.

## Technologies Used

- React.js
- Next.js
- Framer Motion
- Material-UI
- EmailJs

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

```bash
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the dependencies using npm install.
3. Run the development server using npm run dev.
4. Open http://localhost:3000 in your web browser to view the website.
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

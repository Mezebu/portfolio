          In my spare time, I enjoy creating personal projects that give me the
          opportunity to experiment with new technologies and programming
          languages, which helps improve my skills and stay up-to-date with the
          latest trends in frontend development.

          Having creative freedom is another benefit of working on personal
          projects. This freedom allows me to design projects that are in line
          with my interests and hobbies, which can be inspiring and fun.

          Overall, building personal projects as a frontend developer can be a
          rewarding experience that helps me improve my skills, build my
          portfolio, and solve real-world problems. It is also a fun and
          creative way I explore my interests and passions while learning new
          things. Here are some of the projects I have worked on:
